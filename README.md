# Hospital-CMS-Rating

CMS rates hospitals in the US on a scale of 1-5, with the objective of making it easier for patients and consumers to compare the quality of services offered by hospitals.
 
The ratings directly influence the choice of hospitals made by consumers and may significantly impact hospitals' revenues. Thus, it is extremely important for hospitals to understand the methodology that CMS uses for calculating the ratings so that they can work on improving the factors that affect their ratings.
 
This project is focused on developing an approach to calculate hospital ratings and using it to identify areas of improvement for certain hospitals. It will also require a thorough understanding of the rating system developed by CMS.
